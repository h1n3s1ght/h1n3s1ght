Hey my name is Ben Hines.

At 19 years old I ventured into the entrepreneurship arena by assisting in the starting of Fanvester. This experience with our development team inspired me look further into development. I graduated from Miami University with an Interactive Media Studies (or Computer Science equivalent) degree.  This all while working at Apple in nearly a full-time career while putting myself through school.  While at Apple I was awarded merits within Apple for having the highest customer survey scores on the technical side of the store twice. While in the pandemic, I utilized the free time to increase my technical skills by seeking an AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification and a Certification in General Assemblyâ€™s Software Engineering Immersive Course. What excites me moving forward, would be to work as a Software Engineer and eventually lead, a multidimensional software-development team.
I am so happy you are here! Thanks for venturing to my README.md or my About Me. 

Actively pushing myself to learn new things daily. The last few weeks I have been focused on gathering information from multiple API sources. 

Focuses recently have been in the areas of API Gateways and Proxies through Apigee (Edge and X).  I have also been sharpening my Java skills with Spring/SpringBoot/Maven projects.
