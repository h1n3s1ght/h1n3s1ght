Hey my name is Ben Hines.

At the age of 19, I embarked on an entrepreneurial journey by co-founding Fanvester. This experience with our development team ignited my passion for technology and prompted me to explore the vast possibilities it offers. Graduating from Miami University with a degree equivalent to Computer Science, I balanced my education while working nearly full-time at Apple, earning recognition for top customer survey scores.

During the pandemic, I capitalized on my free time to enhance my technical expertise, obtaining an AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification and completing General Assemblyâ€™s Software Engineering Immersive Course. Notably, I swiftly transitioned into a role at SID Global Solutions, where I demonstrated my ability to rapidly learn and contribute effectively. I am now eager to leverage my adaptability, rapid learning skills, and leadership capabilities in a Software Engineer role, with aspirations to lead multidimensional software development teams.

I have been recently sharpening my Java skills with Spring/SpringBoot/Maven projects.
