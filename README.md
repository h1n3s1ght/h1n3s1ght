I am so happy you are here! Thanks for venturing to my README.md or my About Me. 

Aspiring full-stack software engineer. Trying to push myself to learn new things daily. The last few weeks I have been focused on gathering information from multiple API sources. 

I can not wait to begin working with other classmates in General Assembly Cohort.
